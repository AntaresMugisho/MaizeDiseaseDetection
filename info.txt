The images for the first four classes have been collected from the PlantVillage dataset [1]. PlantVillage is a standard and popular leaf image dataset for plant disease detection. We have augmented the images of some classes to address data imbalance issues.

The Northern Leaf Spot images have been collected from the A. Ahmad [2] dataset. We initially found 276 images there and augmented the rest.

The Phaeosphaeria Leaf Spot images have been collected from the Craze [3] dataset. We initially found 149 images there and augmented the rest.
